## Board

The game is played on a hexagonal grid. A variety of maps may be created, but the standard map is a 10x10x10 hexagon. Home spaces are centered on each side one row from the edge.

## Character Tokens

Tokens to represent each character on the Board

## Robot Slave Tokens

Tokens to represent Robot Slaves on the board.

## Cup of Initiative Tokens

A cup of initiative tokens for randomly choosing turn order in each round.

### Initiative Tokens

Initiative tokens to designate turn order. Are drawn at the beginning of each round and kept for the duration of the round. They are numbered from 1-6.
Each has a color on the bottom coresponding to a starting space.

## Health Tracking Tokens

A little thing to place on your health tracker to keep track of your health.

## Player Boards

Each player has their very own board for managing individual gameplay. This board has the following things on it:

- **HP Tracker** - Used to track player HP, the HP Tracker is composed of 21 little squares or dots labeled from _Dead, 1, 2, ..., 19 20_. A marker is initially placed on _10_ but players can gain or lose HP throughout the game. HP may never exeed 20.
- **Item Index** - The item index is _20_ Item Card-shaped "slots" that are labeled from 1-20. Each space has a corresponding marker of the player's color. When an item is placed on the board, the card is placed in the Item Index slot and the corresponding marker is placed on the board.
- **Initiative** - A handy little spot to keep your _initiative token_.

## Hexagonal Tunnel Tiles

What tunnels are made of.

## Item Tokens

20 tokens for each player, each numbered coresponding to an Item Card slot on the Player Board. Each token has a _trap_ side (Spiky) and a _cache_ side (smooth & friendly).

## Item Cards

Item cards are central to the gameplay. Each player starts the Tunneling Phase with 3 Item Cards and the Murdering Phase with 6. See _02-Contents_ for descriptions of each item card.

## Turn Cards

6 cards, one for each player, describe how to play one's turn. One side contains rules for Tunneling Phase turn, the other for Murdering Phase turn.
