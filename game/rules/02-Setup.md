# Setup

### Decide player placement

Before anyone gets comfortable, pass the cup of initiative tokens around. Each player pulls a token from the cup at starts at the space coresponding to the color on the bottom of their token. Return all initiative tokens to the cup.

### Shuffle Tunnel Tiles

This is a team effort. Shuffling hundreds of small hexagons is a lot more complicated than shuffling 52 cards. Players all grab some tiles and scatter them, face down, all over the board... as if feeding hexagonal tiles to a bunch of ducks in a small pond. Don't put more than a couple down at a time. Go nuts with it but make sure they all stay face-down. After all the tiles are scattered, players collect them into 6 roughly even stacks which are then distributed around the outside of the board so they're easily accessible to all players.

### Remove unneeded initiative tokens from cup

You'll only need one token for each player so remove any token whose number is higher than the number of players.

### Arrange your Zone

- Place your character token on your starting space.
- Place your life token on the **10** space on the life counter portion of your player card.
- Put your trap tokens on their respective spaces around the outside of your player card. Or don't; the universe is impermanent. What's the point?
