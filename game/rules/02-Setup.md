# Setup

- Decide player placement
  - Example:
    - Players draw initiative tokens to determine home space positions. This can be done with tokens for all available spaces even if there are more positions than players.
      - (_Optional house rule_: winning player chooses where to sit or elects to try again and allow next player to choose, possibly cascading down to player with losing roll.)
- Shuffle and divide hexagonal tiles into approximately equal stacks equal to the number of players and place one stack next to the edge of the grid in front of each player, face down.
- Shuffle and divide rectangular item cards into approximately equal stacks equal to the number of players and place one stack next to the corner to the left of each player
- Place initiative tokens for number of players in **initiative token pool**
  - 1 and 2 for 2 players, 1-4 for 4 players, all tokens for 6 players, etc.
- Each player does the following:
  - Places character piece on starting position for chosen sextant.
  - Draws 6 hexagonal tiles
