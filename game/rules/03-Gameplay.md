## Gameplay

### Tunneling Phase

In the first phase of the game, players build the map. It is played in rounds until the entire board is filled with tiles.

#### Beginning of round

- All **initiative tokens** are returned to pool.
- Each player chooses an initiative token randomly from the pool. The order in which this is done doesn't matter.
- Players take their turns in order of lowest initiative token.

#### Player Turn

- You may also discard **6** tiles to draw an item card.
- Roll **2d6**
  - Low number is the **draw number**
  - High number is the **play number**
- Draw a number of hexagonal tiles equal to your **draw number**.
  - These can be taken from any stack and can be looked at immediately. Keep all of your tiles hidden, or don't if you want. Who cares?
- Roll **1d6**. If the result is _lower_ than your **play number**, draw an **item card**.
- _If there are no open paths from your origin space_, you're a bastard and stop it. Here's what's gonna happen:
  - Your opponents can bid tiles from their hand as an _offering of dirt_ to decide who gets to _command the great disruptor worm_. The great disruptor worm HATES closed loops:
  - Whoever bids the most tiles commands the disruptor worm to mess up your shit and uses one of their bid tiles to replace a tile of their choosing to open a continuous path to your origin space. They discard the rest to the bottom of whatever pile.
  - If this is a two-player game, your opponent just chooses whether or not to replace one of your tiles with one of theirs.
- Place a number of tiles between 1 and your **play number**. You must play at least one tile each turn.
  - Each tile must continue a path from your origin space.
  - On any tile you play this turn, you may lay one item as either a **trap** or a **cache**.
    - You may only do this once per turn.
- At the end of their turn, player returns their initiative token to the cup.

### Murdering Phase

_Optionally, Discard 1_ of your item cards and then draw until you have _6 item cards_ in your hand.

Similarly to the tunneling phase, the murdering phase is played in rounds. The object of the game is to be the last player alive.

#### Beginning of Round

- Decide initiative the same way as in the Tunneling Phase

#### Player Turn

- **Speed** - Roll 1d6 and add any speed bonuses to determine the number of spaces you can move. You can move up to this many spaces but need not move the full amount.
- **Spring Traps** - If you move into a space where a trap has been placed, you must spring that trap (unless you have an item that allows you to avoid it) _even if you placed it_. If it is a trap card, resolve it with yourself as the target. If it is not a trap card, you may collect it as if it were a cache.
- **Place Items** - You may place any item in your hand on any space you visit, including the ones you start and end on. These items may be placed as _caches_ or _traps_.
- **Gather Caches** - You may gather cached items on any space you visit. Once gathered, you may look at it and choose to keep it in your hand or activate it.
- **Battle Folks** - If, on your turn, you move into the same space as another player's character or one of their minions, you may engage them in _combat_.
- **Dig** - On any turn, a player may attempt to manually dig through a wall. This is especially useful in the event of a cave-in when no proper digging items are available. There are two options available for digging out of a space:
  - _Random digging_: If your aim is simply to get out of a space, you may strike out into a random direction. Roll _1d6_. If you roll a 6, select an adjacent space and roll an additional _1d6_. For your dice roll, move to the nth tile clockwise from the space you selected. (The space you selected for a roll of _1_, the space clockwise of the space you selected for a roll of _2_, etc.) If you end up not even going through a wall, it's not totally your fault; it's dark underground.
  - _Directed digging_: If you want to get to a specific adjacent space, roll _2d6_. On a roll of 10-12, move to any adjacent space.

## Winning

To win the game, a player must be the last living and non-trapped player.

Once all but one player are dead or unable to move, all players unable to move are given _one additional round_ to attempt to dig out of their eternal tombs. If any player frees themselves, even if into another trapped space, play resumes. If all players fail to free themselves, play ends and the free player is declared the winner. Also, I guess, the sounds of celebration enrage the gamma-exposed moles who then drain the blood from all those still trapped in the walls... which explains why they can't just keep trying to dig out. They would need blood for that.
